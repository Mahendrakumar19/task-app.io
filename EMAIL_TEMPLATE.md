Dear Hiring Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm excited to submit my completed Frontend Developer Intern assignment.

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/Mahendrakumar19/task-app.io

## What I Built

I've developed a full-stack task management application with the following features:

✅ **Authentication System**
- User registration and login with JWT
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Token refresh mechanism for better UX
- Protected routes throughout the app

✅ **Task Management Dashboard**
- Complete CRUD operations on tasks
- Real-time statistics (total, pending, in-progress, completed)
- Search functionality across task titles and descriptions
- Filter by status and priority
- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

✅ **Technology Stack**
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB
- Security: JWT authentication, bcrypt, input validation

✅ **Documentation**
- API Documentation: `docs/API.md`
- Postman Collection: `docs/postman_collection.json`
- Scaling Strategy: `docs/SCALABILITY.md`
- Technical Decisions: `APPROACH.md`

## Quick Start

The repository includes detailed setup instructions in the README.md. The application can be running locally in under 5 minutes with:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && npm install && npm run dev

# Frontend  
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

## What I Learned

This project challenged me to think about:
- Implementing secure authentication patterns
- Designing scalable backend architecture
- Creating intuitive user experiences
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Documenting technical decisions

The most interesting challenge was implementing the token refresh interceptor to handle expired tokens gracefully without creating infinite loops.

## Beyond Requirements

I went beyond the basic requirements to demonstrate best practices:
- Dual-token system (access + refresh tokens)
- Database indexing for performance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Professional UI/UX with loading and error states
- Detailed documentation including my technical approach

## What I'd Add Next

Given more time, I'd implement:
- Email verification
- Password reset flow
- Unit and integration tests
- Real-time notifications
- Dark mode
- CI/CD pipeline

I'm genuinely excited about this opportunity and would love to discuss my approach in more detail. I'm available for any questions or to walk through the code.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,  
**Mahendra Kumar**
